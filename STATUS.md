# 7zippy STATUS

**Current focus:** Phase 1 closure COMPLETE. Every codec row has Decode=✅, Encode=✅, Oracle=✅. Phase 2 native rewrites begin: lazippy (LZMA range coder) is the first target — see `memory/7zippy-wrappers-then-native.md`.

**Phase 1 exit criterion** (user-set, 2026-05-13): every codec row reaches **Decode=✅, Encode=✅, Oracle=✅**. Streaming, Bench, and Fuzz columns are not part of the Phase 1 gate.

**Supporting machinery**:
- `make status` → runs `scripts/status.sh` which extracts the "Current focus" line and the next ⬜ row.
- Pre-commit hook warns if a PR touches `src/` but not `STATUS.md`.
- Each sibling crate ships its own internal `STATUS.md` for piece-level state (range coder, literal decoder, etc.) — the umbrella table is codec-level only so it stays scannable.
